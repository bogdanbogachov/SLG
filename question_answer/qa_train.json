Apply a thin coat of TCM\nGasket Sealant P/N #642188-1 to both sides of gasket unless otherwise specified. See\nChapter 3, \"Table Of Sealants and Lubricants,\" for application of gasket sealant. Once TCM\nGasket Sealant has been applied install gasket. Install assembly and evenly torque hardware\nto specified value. This will prevent over stressing gasket.\nWARNING\nGaskets and components must be properly positioned, hardware torqued and\nsafetied as required during assembly to prevent oil loss."
