Apply\na thin translucent coat of Gasket Maker not to exceed .010 inch thick to the surface specified in\nChapter 3, \"Table Of  Sealants and Lubricants.\"\nGasket Maker is an easily workable tacky gel which can be extruded onto one side of a flange\nsurface from a tube and evenly spread. Small parts can be covered adequately by pressing\nthem into a saturated polyester urethane sponge or by roll coating them with a short nap roller.\nOnce Gasket Maker has been applied evenly torque assembly into place. Excess material can\nbe cleaned by wiping with chlorinated solvent. Material on hands can be cleaned with waterless\nmechanics hand soap followed by soap and water.\nNOTE\u2026TCM general purpose primer P/N 653160 must be used for surface preparation\nbefore applying Gasket Maker at the engine nose seal area."
