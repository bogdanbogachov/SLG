All\nsurfaces must be protected from corrosion after cleaning by rinsing with a petroleum base\nsolvent and applying a coat of clean 50 weight aviation engine oil.\nCAUTION\u2026Cleaning methods other than the following may be destructive to engine parts\nand must not be used.\nAluminum Alloy Parts: Degrease aluminum alloy components by spraying or brushing with\nany fortified mineral spirit solvent. Heavy grease or dirt deposits can be cleaned effectively\nby allowing parts to soak in this solvent for a short period of time. Carbon deposits and gum\n(oil varnish) may be removed easily by immersing the part in a hot bath of an inhibited, mild\nalkaline cleaning solution. Immersion time should be only as long as necessary to remove\nthe deposit. Give special attention to cleaning studs, tapped holes and drilled holes. Caution\nmust be exercised when cleaning aluminum alloy parts using any alkaline cleaning solutions.\nImmediately after removing soaked parts from inhibited, mild alkaline bath or hot soapy\nwater, remove all traces of the alkaline by spraying the parts with a jet of steam, or brushing\nvigorously with a mineral spirit solvent. Cleaned parts may be dried by a jet of dry,\ncompressed air to remove all solvent liquids.\nCAUTION\u2026When using alkaline cleaning solutions, the cleaning solution manufacturer's\nusage, safety data and disposal information must be strictly followed. Alkaline etching\nsolutions must not be used.\nCAUTION\u2026All alkaline residues must be removed from crevices, recesses and holes to\nprevent the formation of a foaming emulsion in the engine lubrication oil after reassembly.

Do\nnot scrape parts or use wire brushes, sandpaper, abrasive cloth or abrasive wheels.\nScratches resulting from such methods allow concentrated stress at the scratch and may\ncause fatigue failure.\nBlasting techniques can be employed to remove hard carbon deposits if suitable equipment\nis available. Suitable types of grit for dry blasting are plastic pellets and processed natural\nmaterials such as wheat grains and crushed fruit pits or shells. Air pressure must be adjusted\nto the lowest setting that will produce the desired cleaning action. Small holes and machine\nfinished surfaces must be protected from the blast by seals and covers.\nWARNING\nAll cleaning material must be removed from parts and components after cleaning.\nCAUTION\u2026Do not use sand, metal grit or glass beads for any type of cleaning. If water\nmixed degreasing solutions containing caustic compounds or soap are used to clean\naluminum alloy components they must be thoroughly and completely rinsed with clear boiling\nwater or steam to prevent corrosion.\nCASTINGS: Gasket surfaces must be thoroughly cleaned with a suitable hydrocarbon\nsolvent such as acetone, naphtha, or methyl ethyl keytone (MEK) to remove dirt, oil and\ngrease. Surfaces must be clean, dry and free of all old gasket material before applying new\ngaskets.\nSMALL STEEL PARTS: Degrease steel parts by spraying or brushing with mineral spirit\nsolvent. Heavy grease or dirt deposits can be cleaned effectively by allowing the part to soak\nin this solvent for a short period of time.\nNOTE\u2026See Chapters 7 through 17 for specific individual system component and part\ncleaning instructions."

        "answer": "NOTE\u2026Parts listed in Section 6-6, \"100% Replacement Parts,\" must be replaced and\ntherefore do not require cleaning.\nWARNING\nDuring any cleaning process always follow the cleaning material manufacturer's\ninstructions for use, and Material Safety Data Sheets for safety precautions and\ndisposal information.\nEngine components must be thoroughly cleaned so they can be properly inspected. All\nsurfaces must be protected from corrosion after cleaning by rinsing with a petroleum base\nsolvent and applying a coat of clean 50 weight aviation engine oil.\nCAUTION\u2026Cleaning methods other than the following may be destructive to engine parts\nand must not be used.\nAluminum Alloy Parts: Degrease aluminum alloy components by spraying or brushing with\nany fortified mineral spirit solvent. Heavy grease or dirt deposits can be cleaned effectively\nby allowing parts to soak in this solvent for a short period of time. Carbon deposits and gum\n(oil varnish) may be removed easily by immersing the part in a hot bath of an inhibited, mild\nalkaline cleaning solution. Immersion time should be only as long as necessary to remove\nthe deposit. Give special attention to cleaning studs, tapped holes and drilled holes. Caution\nmust be exercised when cleaning aluminum alloy parts using any alkaline cleaning solutions.\nImmediately after removing soaked parts from inhibited, mild alkaline bath or hot soapy\nwater, remove all traces of the alkaline by spraying the parts with a jet of steam, or brushing\nvigorously with a mineral spirit solvent. Cleaned parts may be dried by a jet of dry,\ncompressed air to remove all solvent liquids.\nCAUTION\u2026When using alkaline cleaning solutions, the cleaning solution manufacturer's\nusage, safety data and disposal information must be strictly followed. Alkaline etching\nsolutions must not be used.\nCAUTION\u2026All alkaline residues must be removed from crevices, recesses and holes to\nprevent the formation of a foaming emulsion in the engine lubrication oil after reassembly. If\nAccelagold surface was removed by the cleaning process it must be re-applied in\naccordance with the procedure in section 6-19, \"Application Of Accelagold.\" [Accelagold is\nmanufactured by Turco\u00ae Products Inc.]\nCAUTION\u2026Alkaline cleaning solutions will cause corrosion to metals if not completely\nremoved.\nCarbon solvent should be employed only when carbon deposits are too hard or thick for\nremoval by other solvents.\nNo polishing compound, abrasive paste or powder is needed for cleaning engine parts. Do\nnot scrape parts or use wire brushes, sandpaper, abrasive cloth or abrasive wheels.\nScratches resulting from such methods allow concentrated stress at the scratch and may\ncause fatigue failure.\nBlasting techniques can be employed to remove hard carbon deposits if suitable equipment\nis available. Suitable types of grit for dry blasting are plastic pellets and processed natural\nmaterials such as wheat grains and crushed fruit pits or shells. Air pressure must be adjusted\nto the lowest setting that will produce the desired cleaning action. Small holes and machine\nfinished surfaces must be protected from the blast by seals and covers.\nWARNING\nAll cleaning material must be removed from parts and components after cleaning.\nCAUTION\u2026Do not use sand, metal grit or glass beads for any type of cleaning. If water\nmixed degreasing solutions containing caustic compounds or soap are used to clean\naluminum alloy components they must be thoroughly and completely rinsed with clear boiling\nwater or steam to prevent corrosion.\nCASTINGS: Gasket surfaces must be thoroughly cleaned with a suitable hydrocarbon\nsolvent such as acetone, naphtha, or methyl ethyl keytone (MEK) to remove dirt, oil and\ngrease. Surfaces must be clean, dry and free of all old gasket material before applying new\ngaskets.\nSMALL STEEL PARTS: Degrease steel parts by spraying or brushing with mineral spirit\nsolvent. Heavy grease or dirt deposits can be cleaned effectively by allowing the part to soak\nin this solvent for a short period of time.\nNOTE\u2026See Chapters 7 through 17 for specific individual system component and part\ncleaning instructions."

        "question": "What are the implications of failing to remove plugs and clean a part thoroughly after magnetic particle inspection on the part's subsequent inspection and use?",
        "answer": "CAUTION\u2026Before magnetic particle inspection of any part, it must be completely cleaned\nand free of dirt, carbon, varnish, gum and paint. Plug small holes leading to obscure cavities\nwith tight-fitting wood plugs or with a hard grease which is soluble in lubricating oil. This will\nprevent particles from lodging in places where they would be difficult to remove and places\nnot subject to visual inspection. After magnetic particle inspection remove all such plugs and\nclean the part thoroughly in solvent. Dry the part with compressed air. Check for complete\ndemagnetization.\nMagnetic particle inspection must be conducted on all ferrous parts.\nWhere magnetic particle inspection is required use fluorescent method wet continuous\nprocedure. Refer to the latest revision of ASTM E 1444 for specific methods and procedures\nbased on the type of inspection being performed.\nACCEPT / REJECT CRITERIA\nRejectable discontinuities are any of the following: fatigue cracks, forming cracks, grinding\nand heat treat cracks, embrittlement cracks, seams, laps, burst.\nParts which contain linear indications which cannot be reworked or indications which break\ninto comers, edges, holes, thread roots, fillets, gear tooth roots or keyways must be rejected.\nThe particular magnetic particle manufacturer's information regarding use, safety data and\ndisposal must be followed carefully."

Stainless steel helical coil inserts of special design are installed in all spark\nplug holes. Any of these inserts may be replaced if damaged. Tools, inserts and information\nare available through HeliCoil\u00ae, Emhart Fastening Teknologies. Contact HeliCoil\u00ae\nApplications Engineering or customer service at: (203) 924-4737 for local distributor\ninformation. The manufacturer's Bulletins 959A, 995, 943, T4000 and 1000 latest revisions\nlist manual and power-driven installing tools, tang break-off tools, special taps, plug gauges\nand tap/drill information. Helical coil inserts are available in both National Course and\nNational Fine series in lengths equal to 1, 1 -1 /2 and 2 times nominal diameter and in pipe\nthread sizes. They are made of either carbon steel, phosphor bronze or stainless steel, as\nspecified by part number. They are supplied with or without a notch above the driving tang.\nThe notch is provided to facilitate breaking off the tang in open holes.\nHelical coil inserts are helical coils of wire with a diamond-shaped cross section forming both\na male and female thread. When compressed into a special tapped hole at the widest part of\nthe wire, between male and female threads, the diameter of the insert is equal to the nominal\nscrew size. The special finishing taps size the casting hole so the pitch diameter of the\nfemale thread of the installed insert conforms to Class 3 fit with standard bolt threads or class\n4 (tight) fit with standard-size studs. The difference in fit is due to a difference in pitch\ndiameters of bolts and studs. Only one set of helical coil special taps is required for\ninstallation of these inserts in both bolt holes and stud holes. Tap drilling depths and tapping\ndepth for helical coil inserts to be installed in blind holes should conform to the\nrecommendations relative to inserts of length equal to 2 times nominal diameter, as tabulated\nin the manufacturer's Bulletin Numbers 1000 and T4000 latest revision. Helical coil tap drills\nand special taps must be run in perpendicular to the machined surface of the casting. Drilling\nmust be done in a drill press after the casting is firmly supported, clamped and alignment\nchecked. The tap will tend to follow the drilled hole. For drilling and tapping aluminum alloy\ncastings use a commercial grade cutting lubrication oil to prevent overheating of the metal\nand tearing of the thread."

The manufacturer's Bulletins 959A, 995, 943, T4000 and 1000 latest revisions\nlist manual and power-driven installing tools, tang break-off tools, special taps, plug gauges\nand tap/drill information. Helical coil inserts are available in both National Course and\nNational Fine series in lengths equal to 1, 1 -1 /2 and 2 times nominal diameter and in pipe\nthread sizes. They are made of either carbon steel, phosphor bronze or stainless steel, as\nspecified by part number. They are supplied with or without a notch above the driving tang.\nThe notch is provided to facilitate breaking off the tang in open holes.\nHelical coil inserts are helical coils of wire with a diamond-shaped cross section forming both\na male and female thread. When compressed into a special tapped hole at the widest part of\nthe wire, between male and female threads, the diameter of the insert is equal to the nominal\nscrew size. The special finishing taps size the casting hole so the pitch diameter of the\nfemale thread of the installed insert conforms to Class 3 fit with standard bolt threads or class\n4 (tight) fit with standard-size studs. The difference in fit is due to a difference in pitch\ndiameters of bolts and studs. Only one set of helical coil special taps is required for\ninstallation of these inserts in both bolt holes and stud holes. Tap drilling depths and tapping\ndepth for helical coil inserts to be installed in blind holes should conform to the\nrecommendations relative to inserts of length equal to 2 times nominal diameter, as tabulated\nin the manufacturer's Bulletin Numbers 1000 and T4000 latest revision. Helical coil tap drills\nand special taps must be run in perpendicular to the machined surface of the casting. Drilling\nmust be done in a drill press after the casting is firmly supported, clamped and alignment\nchecked. The tap will tend to follow the drilled hole. For drilling and tapping aluminum alloy\ncastings use a commercial grade cutting lubrication oil to prevent overheating of the metal\nand tearing of the thread."

They are supplied with or without a notch above the driving tang.\nThe notch is provided to facilitate breaking off the tang in open holes.\nHelical coil inserts are helical coils of wire with a diamond-shaped cross section forming both\na male and female thread. When compressed into a special tapped hole at the widest part of\nthe wire, between male and female threads, the diameter of the insert is equal to the nominal\nscrew size. The special finishing taps size the casting hole so the pitch diameter of the\nfemale thread of the installed insert conforms to Class 3 fit with standard bolt threads or class\n4 (tight) fit with standard-size studs. The difference in fit is due to a difference in pitch\ndiameters of bolts and studs. Only one set of helical coil special taps is required for\ninstallation of these inserts in both bolt holes and stud holes. Tap drilling depths and tapping\ndepth for helical coil inserts to be installed in blind holes should conform to the\nrecommendations relative to inserts of length equal to 2 times nominal diameter, as tabulated\nin the manufacturer's Bulletin Numbers 1000 and T4000 latest revision. Helical coil tap drills\nand special taps must be run in perpendicular to the machined surface of the casting. Drilling\nmust be done in a drill press after the casting is firmly supported, clamped and alignment\nchecked. The tap will tend to follow the drilled hole. For drilling and tapping aluminum alloy\ncastings use a commercial grade cutting lubrication oil to prevent overheating of the metal\nand tearing of the thread."

        "answer": "1. Prior to cleaning the cylinder assemblies, inspect them for any signs of head to barrel\nleakage, leaking oil, fuel, exhaust or combustion residue and any condition that could\nindicate loss of integrity of the cylinder assembly or the cylinder head to barrel junction.\nInspect the cylinder barrel fins and fin tips for rust pitting and damage in the power stroke\nstress areas. Discard any cylinder with the above described conditions. Inspect the\nremainder of the cylinder barrel, barrel fins, fin tips and cylinder base flange for rust pitting\nand damage that cannot be repaired in accordance with the instructions in section 15-6.\nDiscard all cylinders which cannot be repaired.\n2. Discolored or burnt paint may indicate piston and piston pin scoring of the cylinder bore\ncaused by overheating. Scored cylinder barrel bores and barrel bores that have been\noverheated must be discarded and replaced. Do not attempt to remove overheating\ndamage by grinding cylinder bore to the next allowable oversize. Cylinder barrel\noverheating can destroy the strength of the material."
